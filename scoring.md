# Categories

In our competition description we announced that we would supply the judges with questions to illustrate each category. This section will contain short descriptions, and those guiding questions. Keep in mind that those questions are just illustrative, and not exhaustive. Each category is more complex, and there are ways to address these issues that go beyond those questions. Consequently, the questions are not a checkbox list - so if there are 5 questions, you should not just give 2 points for each. You should rather ask, how well did the AI perform here compared to a regular human. 

## Adaptability:
Adaptability is about how well a given settlement fits into the map and the surrounding terrain. Is the design shaped by the given map, and is the map in turn shaped by the settlement. The challenge here is to not just generate something that can be put on any map, but to generate something that reflects the input (the map). 

- Do the structures in the settlement adapt to the terrain?
- Do the structure in the environment reflect the environment, i.e. usage of available material, adaptation to the biome?
- Does the settlement take advantage of terrain features or compensate for problems with the terrain?
- Are the settlements different in reaction to the different initial maps?
- Are there any other ways in how the settlement adapts to the given maps?

## Functionality:
Settlements in general, and in Minecraft in particular, are not just aesthetic artefacts but also provide functionality in different forms. There are different kinds of functionality. First, there are issues that are not even dependent on Minecraft, like how easy it is to walk through the settlement, or how easy it is to navigate. There are also functions that are more closely tied to the game Minecraft, like keeping the monsters out, or providing enough light so monsters donâ€™t spawn, or making food and crafting stations accessible to the player. This is definitely a category where the list of questions is not exhaustive - it is possible to provide extra affordances that we have not thought of. 

- Does the settlement provide protection from danger?
- Does it keep mobs from spawning?
- Does it keep mobs out?
- Protection from other environmental dangers?
- Is the settlement accessible to a player avatar in survival mode?
- Can you walk everywhere?
- Does the settlement provide faster modes of transport?
- How easy is it to find your way around?
- Does the settlement provide the player with additional affordances?
- Does the settlement make ressources easy to obtain?
- Is there an easy way to get food?
- Does the settlement provide functionality to the villagers?
- Does the settlement reflect the embodiment of the player avatar?
- Is it appropriately scaled?

## Evocative Narrative:
In real life settlements tell stories about the people who build them, about their lives, their culture, and their history. Settlements are also living testaments to the history that shaped them. When we look at settlements in reality, or even those designed by humans for games, we get a sense of what this settlement is about, or how it was shaped over time. The challenge here is to automatically produce a settlement that evokes a distinct story - and ideally one that is adapted to the underlying input, the map. 

- Is the settlement evoking an interesting story?
- After looking at the settlement, could you give a short description of what this settlement is about that sets it apart from other settlements?
- Is it clear what the function of the settlement is?
- Does this function make sense in regards to the terrain and environment it is in? I.e. is the logging camp in a forest, the harbour town at the sea?
- Is the functionality of the settlement supporting this narrative function? I.e. does the fortified frontier settlement have functioning walls, is the farming village equipped with functioning fields?
- Does the final settlement give any indication of how the settlement developed?
- Is it possible to look at the settlement and imagine in what order things were built, or what stages the development of the settlement took?
- Is there an indication of the history of the settlement evident in the structure?
- Are there any convincing and consistent allusions to human cultures or specific points in history that the settlement is modelled after?
- Does the settlement have a culture - either fictional or historical, that is evident from the settlement?
- Do you know things about this culture just by looking at the settlement?

## Maintaining Aesthetics:
The last criterion is not necessarily about beauty, but about a consistent look. The challenge here is not only to produce something that looks like good design, but to do so, while also addressing the other challenges. It is somewhat simple to design a really great looking house, and just copy it down several times. But having an algorithm design houses and have them look well designed is a different question. This category contains a lot of elements that humans might get right without thinking about it, like building houses that are visually balanced, or well proportioned. In its corollary, this category is also about avoiding those jarring, strange artefacts that procedural design generates that would never be made by a human. 

- Does the settlement look good?
- Is there a consistent look to the settlement? Does it appear that all structures belong to the same settlement?
- Is there an appropriate level of variation in the existing structures?
- Are there any jarring features that make the settlement look unbelievable?
